### svelte-example-museums

How to make a svelte app compatible with IE11.

#### Updates from the original fork

- Updated Rollup and dependencies to later major version.
- Added stronger support for core-js polyfills, resolving potential gotchas for devs new to all this.

Technologies used:

- rollup
- babel
- core-js
- SCSS via [Svelte Preprocess](https://github.com/kaisermann/svelte-preprocess#readme)

Check the final [rollup config](https://github.com/jayliu50/svelte-example-museums/blob/master/rollup.config.js) of this.

This is a copy of the official [Svelte Template](https://github.com/sveltejs/template).

PS: As you might see, I did not find an elegant way to share styles across multiple svelte components. If you know a way, let me know :)
